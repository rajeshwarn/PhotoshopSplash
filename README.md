# PhotoshopSplash
 An example of creating splash screens similar to the Adobe Photoshop splash by using PNG images with alpha transparency. The desktop beneath the splash form is captured to a bitmap and the PNG is then superimposed over the bitmap. Finally, an illusion is created by placing and showing the bitmap exactly over the captured area of the desktop.
### Some Screenshots
